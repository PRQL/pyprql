Currently, the source code is divided as follows:

- `cli` module contains the command line interface logic.
  See [Command Line Interface](./cli.md).
- `magic` module that implements the PRQL IPython/Jupyer magic.
  See [IPython and Jupyter Magic](./magic.md).
- `assets` sub-package that contains a number of useful references.
  See [Assets](./assets.md).
