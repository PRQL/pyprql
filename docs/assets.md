This module contains no code.
Rather,
it contains a number of text files in which we store various information used by the CLI.

Currently,
there are 5 files:

1. `cli_bottom_toolbar.txt`: the help message in the bottom bar of the CLI.
1. `cli_usage.txt`: the help messages printed when the CLI is run with no arguments.
1. `examples.txt`: some example PRQL queries.
1. `prql_mode_help.txt`: help printed in the CLI when in `prql` mode.
1. `sql_mode_help.txt`: help printed in the CLI when in `sql` mode.
